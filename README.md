# GameVault Web Frontend

React 19 + Vite + Tailwind (v4) powered frontend for the GameVault platform.

## Tech Stack

- PNPM
- React 19 / Vite 7

- Tauri

## Setup

`pnpm install`

## Scripts

- dev/start: Run local development server

## Notes

The project was migrated from a basic Vite template; most custom styling now relies on Tailwind utilities with a small set of extended theme tokens.
